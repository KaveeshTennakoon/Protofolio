      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm <strong>T.M. Kaveesh Madusanka Tennakoon</strong>, a
        passionate and dedicated BSc Computer Science student at the University
        of Westminster (IIT). My academic journey has been centered around
        programming and building web applications, with a particular interest in
        machine learning and data science.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Throughout my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in various
        programming languages and technologies, including Python, Django, Java,
        SQL, Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and numerous Python libraries. My
        technical skills are complemented by a deep curiosity and enthusiasm for
        continuous learning and problem-solving.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        One of my proudest achievements to date is winning the 1st runner-up
        position in a team coding competition, which highlighted my ability to
        work collaboratively and think critically under pressure. Although I
        have not yet had formal internships or work experience, I have completed
        several personal projects that showcase my capabilities and dedication
        to the field.
      </p>
    <br>
      <p>
        Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy photography, playing chess, and
        traveling. These hobbies not only provide a creative outlet but also
        help me maintain a balanced and well-rounded lifestyle.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        I am driven by a desire to become a successful professional in the IT
        field, with long-term goals of becoming a data scientist or machine
        learning engineer. Additionally, I have a keen interest in web
        development and aim to continue building and refining my skills in this
        area.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I invite you to explore my projects
        and learn more about my journey. Feel free to connect with me if you
        share similar interests or if you have any exciting opportunities to
